## Schedule

During the initial stages of our project, we made significant progress, swiftly tackling tasks like UI design and feature selection with confidence. The frontend implementation proceeded smoothly, boosting team morale. However, we encountered unexpected challenges when integrating the React frontend with the Flask backend.
Issues such as naming inconsistencies and API format discrepancies slowed our progress and hindered our goal of delivering a polished final product. Despite our initial timeline projections, these technical obstacles, coupled with academic commitments, led to project extensions, pushing us close to the deadline.
This experience underscored the importance of integration testing from the project's outset. By prioritizing testing early on, we aim to streamline future development efforts, preemptively addressing potential hurdles. Reflecting on this setback, we recognize the need for meticulous planning and proactive risk management in all our endeavors.
GUI design evolution
We're thrilled to share that our final GUI design closely mirrors our initial vision laid out in Figma at the start of the project. While we stayed true to the original design, we took the opportunity to enhance the user experience further.
One significant change was our emphasis on mobile-first design. Recognizing the increasing importance of mobile usability, we expanded certain features originally intended for desktop to be fully functional on mobile devices. This involved extra effort to ensure smooth operation and easy navigation on smaller screens.
Comparing our final product to the initial Figma design, you'll notice striking similarities. We intentionally maintained the same color scheme and design elements to create a consistent and user-friendly experience.
In addition to functional improvements, we also fine-tuned the aesthetics to enhance the overall appeal of the UI. While making these adjustments, we remained faithful to the core design principles established during the project's inception. This allowed us to strike a balance between consistency and innovation in our GUI evolution.
 Unexpected challenges
1. Integration of Frontend and Backend: Initially, the lack of synchronization between frontend and backend development posed a significant challenge, causing notable schedule setbacks. To address this, we organized multiple in-person group coding sessions involving both frontend and backend teams. These collaborative sessions facilitated real-time communication and problem-solving, expediting the integration process.
2. Firebase and NoSQL Schema: Many team members encountered a steep learning curve with Firebase and NoSQL schema, as these technologies were unfamiliar to us. To overcome this challenge, team members utilized resources such as YouTube tutorials to gain a better understanding of Firebase's capabilities and best practices. This proactive approach enabled us to effectively leverage Firebase for our project's database needs.
3. Mobile-Friendly CSS Development: Converting all pages to be mobile-friendly presented a considerable challenge, particularly for team members with limited expertise in CSS development. To mitigate this challenge, we leveraged ChatGPT to provide guidance and insights on optimizing our CSS code for mobile responsiveness. This AI-driven assistance proved invaluable in streamlining the mobile optimization process and ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## Knowledge gaps
Before starting the project, we realized there were some technologies we weren't very familiar with, like Firebase and Docker. While a few team members had some experience with them, they were mostly new to us as a team.
To get up to speed, we took a proactive approach. For Firebase, we did our own research, digging into the official documentation and checking out existing Firebase databases. This hands-on exploration helped us get the hang of Firebase and feel more confident using it for our project's backend.
Similarly, with Docker, even though it was covered in our course, we needed to dive deeper to really understand how it works. We spent time learning on our own, using online tutorials and resources to get the hang of Docker's concepts and workflows. By trying things out and learning together as a team, we gradually got better at using Docker for containerization and deployment.
Throughout the project, we made sure to support each other in our learning. Whenever someone hit a roadblock or needed help, we shared what we knew and learned from each other. This collaborative environment helped us grow and tackle the challenges of the project together.

## Successes and Shortcomings
Reflecting on our project, we encountered both successes and challenges. Notably, we are proud of successfully implementing our mock interview page and tracking page. These components proved to be the most complex aspects of the project, demanding a deep understanding of both Python and JavaScript libraries. Additionally, integrating Google's audio-to-text API for transcribing video audio on the frontend added an extra layer of complexity. Overcoming these hurdles required extensive collaboration and problem-solving skills from our team.
Our release plan goals were mostly met. We successfully implemented all essential features for the initial release, including the mock interview page, tracking page, and mobile support. However, some post-launch features, such as candidate bookmarking, were not fully implemented as originally planned. This was mainly due to time constraints and the complexity involved in integrating certain functionalities.
Despite these challenges, the successful integration of the OpenAI API and the smooth execution of mobile support demonstrate our team's resilience and adaptability. Looking ahead, we aim to address the identified shortcomings and leverage our successes to further enhance the project's functionality and user experience.

## Overall Project Rating
We've evaluated our project and assigned it a rating of 7 - 8 out of 10 based on several key factors. While we're proud of the successful implementation of all core functionalities, we recognize areas where improvements can be made.
One significant area for improvement lies in the database structure. Currently, there are inconsistencies in the information stored for seekers and recruiters, which could potentially disrupt the frontend implementation if not addressed. Although we had plans to clean and reseed the Firebase database, the extensive nature of the project meant that we couldn't complete this task within the allotted time frame. Nonetheless, rectifying these inconsistencies remains a top priority for future development efforts.
Moreover, while the overall user interface of our application is commendable for its user-friendliness and aesthetic appeal, we've identified some inconsistencies in frontend styling. For example, the signup form for new seeker accounts isn't centrally aligned on the screen, and there may be variations in button colors across different pages. Although these issues are primarily cosmetic and don't significantly impact functionality, addressing them would further improve the overall user experience.
Despite these identified areas for improvement, our project has achieved a high rating due to its successful implementation of core features and usability. We're committed to addressing these shortcomings and continually enhancing our platform to better serve our users.
